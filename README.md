# 20_Newsgroup_NLP_Capstone_Project

Exploring and modelling the 20 Newsgroups data set
Dataset description:
the 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 19K newsgroup documents. The original form of this dataset is at this page: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

Inspiration:
Classifying text documents into various news groups

Sections:Â¶
Preparing full, train and test data set
Data cleaning: removing stopwords, filter out short words, stemming and lemmatization
vectorization: tf_idf
comparison Naive_Bayes performance between applying stemming and lemmatization
Exploring different ngrams in the vectorizer step
Exploring various ML algorithms: SVC, Logistic regression, Random forest, and Gradient boosting
Inspecting the top words calcualted by Naive_bayes
Text extraction: lsa, lda, and nnmf
Unsupervised learning with LSA: KMeans and GaussianMixture
Text summarization: tf_idf, calculate similarity, rank sentences based on scores
